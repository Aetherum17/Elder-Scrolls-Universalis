#Destruction school

Ice Storm

Adept

Creating a frost whirlwind which takes away 40 health points and 40 stamina points per second. This is one of the available frost spells and you should at least give it a try.

Icy Spear

Expert

Creating an icy spear that attacks with frost damage, taking away 60 health points and 60 stamina points. This is one of the available frost spells and you should at least give it a try.

Thunderbolt

Expert

Attacking the target with shock damage that takes away 60 health points and 30 mana points. This is an extremely useful spell, however if you don't have enough mana to use it often you can also consider weaker shock spells.

Wall of Frost

Expert

Creating a wall of ice that inflicts 50 frost damage per second when touched. I strongly recommend casting this spell in small areas, so that enemies will have hard time finding alternative paths to you and they'll be hitting the wall more frequently.

Wall of Storms

Expert

Creating a wall of lightning that inflicts 50 shock damage per second when touched. I strongly recommend casting this spell in small areas, so that enemies will have hard time finding alternative paths to you and they'll be hitting the wall more frequently.

Lightning Storm

Master

Attacking the targets with shock damage that takes away 75 health points and 37 mana points per second. The only way to unlock this spell is to purchase a spell tome from Faralda after completing Ritual destruction spell College of Winterhold quest. The spell itself is extremely powerful and you should use it often, however remember to precisely target enemy units for best effects.
