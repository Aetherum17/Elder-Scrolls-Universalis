 banished_from_aldmeris_mission_title:0 "Banished from Aldmeris"
 banished_from_aldmeris_mission_desc:0 "Early in the dawn era, before there was any way of recording the actual events that occurred, it is rumoured that an ancient elven homeland existed named 'Aldmeris.' It is believed among inhabitants of Pyandonea that the Maormer, originally the lords of Aldmeris and masters of Altmer were wrongly banished to Pyandonea, the 'Veil of Mists,' to prevent its inhabitants from ever returning to Aldmeris and claiming their birthright. Others will claim that the mMormer originally stood as equals among the Altmer and it was a noble coup led by the fabled wizard Orgnum that would ultimately backfire and lead to his followers being banished to the insect infested isles of Pyandonea. The Altmer of Summerset, even, have their own version of the story that outright denies the Maormer claim to Aldmeris and even implies the maormer were at one time unruly subjects of the Altmer. Regardless, having migrated to the rough and unpredictable terrain of Pyandonea the Maormer must make the best of their situation and build up their resources so they may eventually reunite and take back their homeland, forging a new history for their people."

 defending_new_home_mission_desc:0 "Having found themselves in the dreaded marshes of Pyandonea the Maormer decided to make the best of their situation and develop an impossibly efficient defense system, capable of repelling any future would-be invaders, as well as allowing the local tribes of Pyandonea a better position in their vy for islandic power."

 sequestering_sealanes_mission_desc:0 "Among the trials and tribulations of the early Maormer finding their way in a foreign land was the process of integrating the local flora and fauna into their culture and possibly even gene pool. One can only feel grateful that they themselves were not witness to whatever process domestication of sea serpents involved, and shake in fear at the prospect of meeting such soldiers in battle. The use of these steads was imperative in combating the religious doom among the Pyandoneans as well as keeping subjects on the island in line."

 fortifying_fenna_mission_title:0 "Fortifying Fenna"
 fortifying_fenna_mission_desc:0 "Pyandonea, with its harsh and unforgiving environment, was originally meant to keep the Maormer from finding their way home. However the Maormer have better intentions for the island. First Pyandonea must be fortified from itself, to prevent would be local tribes from exerting dominance. Then Pyandonea must be conquered and united, fortified and protected from outside invaders before the search for a new homeland begins."
 abolishing_abbarbas_mission_title:0 "Abolishing Abbarbas"
 abolishing_abbarbas_mission_desc:0 "Throughout the unification process of Pyandonea there was much fretting and national unrest due to the impending doom of Shakatal and inevitably many subjects, tribes, local militias, client states, etc. were required to manage the growing island nation. Integration of these smaller states and conquest of the larger states has created issues of autonomy, especially in the metropolis of Abbarbas where a large concentration of Maormer live. In order to forge an empire the nation must first forge intself."
 trading_in_tiguna_mission_title:0 "Trading in Tiguna"
 trading_in_tiguna_mission_desc:0 "Having been exiled to Pyandonea the majority of goods and trade is based on domestic production within Pyandonea itself. It is imperative that the nation gains dominance over trade and becomes the Island's leader so that one day the Maormer may move their trade to Summerset."
 innovating_eilyse_mission_title:0 "Innovating Eilyse"
 innovating_eilyse_mission_desc:0 "With the impending doom of Sakatel a constant issue among inhabitants of Pyandonea it is imperative that this nation stays ahead of innovation, doing what's necessary not to sacrifice its ruler and fall into despair. When this nation has arisen from its slumber and can walk among the other giants of Nirn it will be ready to expand out and eventually take on Summerset."
 venerating_vallas_bor_mission_title:0 "Venerating Vallas Bor"
 venerating_vallas_bor_mission_desc:0 "Much of the Maormer religion is complex and unknown, due to their mysterious and extremely remote location. What is known is that they venerate a snake-god, referenced here as , the omnideity of the Yokudan pantheon (on a comparable station to Auri-El): the creator and destroyer of worlds. This snake-god has turned sinister and has demanded a periodic tribute of subjects in return for favors. Refusing to gather up the necessary subjects will incur his wrath and bring doom upon the unfortunate nations of Pyandonea. To appease him it may be necessary to build temples in his honor."

 sublimation_deity_mission_title:0 "Sublimation of a Living Deity"
 sublimation_deity_mission_desc:0 "Many rumors circulate the ethos of Orgnum. It is believed that he was once a wealthy Altmer merchant who lived in Old Aldmeris and attempted a noble coup against the Old Empire there. Having failed the coup he was exiled to Pyandonea with his supporters and the population there eventually came to become the modern day Maormer. There is also the belief, extremely rooted in the subconscious of all maormer, that Orgnum is the deity , creator and destroyer of worlds, who has come to Pyandonea to rule over the people there in order to bring them up and allow them to reclaim their birthright of Summerset Isles, land that has always rightly belonged to the Maormer... at least according to the Maormer themselves. One thing remains certain: Orgnum is a powerful wizard who is not only immortal, but grows younger by the year. After being deified and worshipped by the whole of Pyandonea and having united the region under a dominate rule the God-King has decicded to ascend to the throne of Pyandonea and become sublimated as living deity on Nirn."

 voyaging_valenwood_mission_desc:0 "The first and final goal of the Maormer is and will always be conquest of Summerset. However upon discovery of the Altmer Islands the Maormer noted the strong HRE presence in the region and realized that in order to carry out a succesful invasion allies would be required in mainland Tamriel who would be open to combatting the imperial elven political axis. The closest and most appealing choice are the Bosmer, who remain apparently neutral in imperial affairs and share the maormeren lust for war and stealth-based military tactics."

 preparing_pyandonea_mission_desc:0 "While declaration of the national entity known as Pyandonea was an arduous task the fight is not over. In order to invade Summerset the Maormer must first secure the region and put all their resources into preparing for their new foes."
 search_new_aldmeris_mission_title:0 "Search for New Aldmeris"
 search_new_aldmeris_mission_desc:0 "Initial inquiries into the Summerset Region have revealed that the Altmer are well fortified and have a complex network of alliances and imperial presence that will make outright invasion suicidal at best. However all is not lost: a significant portion of the land in summerset has been uncolonized and remains an open pasture. The Altmer have taken this land for granted, leaving it unprotected and without imperial authority. If the Maormer can take footholds in Summerset and Auridon it will be possible to lay claim to all uncolonized land in the name of Pyandonea."

The Ayleid elves, while under a heavy imperial influence, may be keen on helping the Maormer if it gives them a strategic advantage against their potential rivals, the Altmer."
 khenarthis_roost_mission_title:0 "Looting Khenarthi's Roost"
 khenarthis_roost_mission_desc:0 "Once alliances were secured in eastern Tamriel the Maormer began to explore and privateer the southern coast, often encroaching upon Elsweyr and the Nibenean Coast. Over time the Maormer began to circulate around Mistral, along the peninsula of Khenarthi's Roost, for its close location and rich moonsugar production. Initially hostile the Maormer privateered the island relentlessly until the owners of Mistral decided to ameliorate the Maormer and allow them shared access. This relationship would also allow Maormer occultism to exist alongside Khajitan worship of Khenarthi. In return the Maormer would cease privateering of the island and enjoy political partnership over the area. The Maormer must decide if they want to continue privateering profits off the Elsweyren coast, take the city through conquest, or cede privateering relations in return for shared control of Mistral."

 summerset_invasion_mission_desc:0 "The Maormer, once established on the Isles of Summerset began developing rapidly and interacting with the local cultures. Inevitably some adoption of culture and practices occured which allowed for technological and cultural growth among the Maormer. Once marches were created along the Altmer borders the Maormer felt secure enough to begin a succesful invasion that was not simply another failed coastal raid."

 sun_mer_set_mission_desc:0 "The Maormer, was foreign to the lands of Summerset, are now its masters. Having united the Isles and surrounding regions including Pyandonea the world has taken to Summerset, appraising it as the capital of the world and where the majority of money is to be found. The Heartlands of Cyrodiil, formerly the center of Tamriel in regards to economy and culture, is now a forgotten memory as nations from all over the continent flock to the ports of Summerset, now in the hands of the Maormer."

 maormernifest_mission_desc:0 "The initial inquiry into Summerset and eventual footholds there pleased King Orgnum but did not satisfy him. In a fit of passion he has proclaimed all of Summerset to be under the domain of 'maormernifest destiny,' indoctrinating in the hearts and minds of all Maormer the belief that they have unprovoked access to the uncolonized regions of Summerset."

 parlaying_pirates_mission_title:0 "Parlaying with Pirates"
 parlaying_pirates_mission_desc:0 "Having established relations with mainland Tamriel the Maormer began to notice many opportunities to use their expert naval skills in combat and for utilitarian purposes. Sending out privateers to various trade cities along the western coast of Tamriel has provided a huge economic boost, however they are running into neigboring pirates who may prove to be better friends than rivals. After a few brief meetings with corsairs in the area it appears they are welcome to allowing the Maormer political dominance in the area in return for a protective alliance against potential enemies in Tamriel. This arrangement greatly pleases both parties. Additionally, the pirates have located the potential location of King Orgnum's coffer, lost at sea long ago. They claim that Topal the Pilot has 'recovered' it during his adventurers in Nirn and it resides on his island in the bay of Nibenay. No enemies of fabrication, the pirates have agreed to forge essential documents giving Pyandonea claim to Topal's land... and treasure, provided Pyandonea is powerful enough to offer signiciant protection."
 aldmeris_union_mission_title:0 "The Aldmeris Union"
 aldmeris_union_mission_desc:0 "The Maormer were wrongly persecuted from their rightful home in Aldmeris long ago, exiled to Pyandonea, terrible and ferocious land unfit for even the lowest demons of Oblivion. Once Aldmer themselves they were transformed into the vicious and ephemeral Maormer throughout time and exposure to their environment while the Altmer of Summerset grew pompoous and secure in the titles. Drawing up very ancient documenteds and records of Aldmer dominion Orgnum has set claim to the thrones of Alinor and Firsthold, declaring that he alone is the rightful ruler of Aldmeris and its progeny: Summerset and Pyandonea. While the Altmer refuse to acknowledge such a claim this has not prevented Orgnum from setting his sights on the Summerset throne."

 righting_sinistrals_mission_desc:0 "The Left Handed Elves, residing on the sinking continent of Yokuda, were once a great empire stretching across land that would engulf Tamriel several times over. There time is ending, however, as the majority of their empire sinks into the open sea. While the Maormer were unaware of the exact causes of this phenomenon they were quick to exploit the failing species and eviscerate their already dying culture."

 yearning_yath_mission_desc:0 "Orgnum, also known as the great God Sakatel, has claimed to be rightful Deity and ruler over the entire continent of Yokuda. He has even claimed to be the reagent behind the continental collapse into the sea. While his claims seem a bit spurious, his will is not, and the God has spoken. Sakatel, Yokudan God of Everything, has spoken. And his will is to rule over not just Summerset, but the entirely of Yokuda as well."

 harassing_hews_bane_mission_desc:0 "Early in the days of the 'Ra Gada' (later: redguard) a nobleman named Prince Hew came to modern-day Anwein and attempted a massive terraformation effort to bring fertility and life to the barren landscape. His attempts became foils and failures at every turn as the cantankerous environment refused to budge and the land became known as 'Hew's Bane.' Following his death the peninsula fell into political disrepair and certain locations were built up into sprawling half-walled metropoli. It was during this power vacuum that a strong pirate influence infiltrated the area and finally the Maormer came to reside their as a permanent political fixture. As foreign presence grew so did the tensions with the surrounding inhabitants of Hammerfell."

 search_for_topal_mission_desc:0 "Information from our corsair allies has provided us with the location of King Orgnum's coffer, located on Topal the Pilot's island in the Nibenean Bay. Conquering the island has not only returned an indispensable artifact to its rightful owner but also provided a base of operations for dealing with Cyrodiil and the empires existing there. The Maormer are heavily invested in gaining political power in the heartlands of Tamriel but must first improve relations with the surrounding population in Nibenay so passage into the Basin may be acquired."
