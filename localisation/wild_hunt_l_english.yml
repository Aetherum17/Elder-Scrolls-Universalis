 wild_hunt:0 "The Wild Hunt"
 wild_hunt.1.t:0 "The Wild Hunt"
 wild_hunt.1.d:0 "Due to the increasing foreign encroachment on Bosmer lands there has been much talk of the Bosmer beginning the Wild Hunt, the events of which are swathed in fear and mystery by all except the oldest Bosmer. Apparently in the old times of the dawn era, the time of the Ooze, Bosmer existed in a gaseous form, a vaporous maelstrom of mercurial destruction. The great Y'ffre was able to give form to the Bosmer but also gave them the ability to revert to their primordial form, a cannibalistic orgy consuming everything in its path. We heard of the tales and didn't take them seriously. Now we must accept the consequences of our careless expansion into the ancient forests of Valenwood."
 wild_hunt.1.flight:0 "We are forced to reconsider our expansion."
 wild_hunt_flight:0 "Appease Y'ffre"
 desc_wild_hunt_flight:0 "After witnessing the unsightly roil of the Wild Hunt we must reconsider our expansion and try to amend relations with the bosmer."
 wild_hunt.1.fight:0 "This abomination of nature must be stopped!"
 wild_hunt_fight:0 "Wild West"
 desc_wild_hunt_fight:0 "We have decided to stand together against the mighty maelstrom despite its ancestral maw chewing through our arms and armor."
 wild_hunt.2.t:0 "End to the Wild Hunt"
 wild_hunt.2.d:0 "We have survived the Wild Hunt and live to forge another day. The intense amalgamation of woodland spirits rapidly depleted resources in Valenwood and the surrounding provinces. Many died in the wake of ensuing destruction, and worse, many are left without a home, families, or even history. Some question the efficacy of the hunt and if it was even necessary: the Bosmer most of all. Coming to terms with the dramatically irreversible consequences of their actions the former wood elves drag themselves through decimated landscapes, returning home to their watering holes only to witness the disfigured phantasmagoria staring back."
 wild_hunt.2.end:0 "Thank the Gods!"
 wild_hunt_end:0 "Rising from the Ashes"
 desc_wild_hunt_end:0 "The devastation known as the Wild Hunt is over. Now we may pick up the pieces of our ravaged countryside."
 wild_hunt.3.t:0 "Consequences of the Wild Hunt"
 wild_hunt.3.d:0 "The Wild Hunt is an ancient magic taught to us by the Great Y’ffre, allowing Bosmer to return to their primordial form: a vaporous seething swirling mass capable of pure destruction. While some Bosmer consider this to be the ultimate weapon, others are beginning to realize the complete consequences of ‘pure’ destruction."
 wild_hunt_backlash:0 "Landscape Decimated"
 desc_wild_hunt_backlash:0 "We have summoned the ancients and invoked the Wild Hunt. Now we must deal with the consequences of our unbridled behemoth."

 wild_hunt.3.ret:0 "We will fight back."
 wild_hunt_retaliate:0 "Wild Hunt Retaliation"
 desc_wild_hunt_retaliate:0 "While the Bosmer are certainly responsible for invoking the Wild Hunt, not all were consulted and some are even outright opposed to unleashing this monstrosity."
 wild_hunt.3.hid:0 "We didn't sign up for this."
 wild_hunt_hide:0 "Powerless"
 desc_wild_hunt_hide:0 "We have decided to do nothing but hide in the wake of imminent destruction. We are nothing but cowards, powerless against the consequences of our own actions."
 wild_hunt.4.t:0 "Bosmer Religious Rites"
 wild_hunt.4.d:0 "Our enemies have felt the unbridled power of the Wild Hunt yet still do not take us, or our gods, seriously. They doubt the power of Y’ffre and claim the Wild Hunt to be simple prestidigitations and campfire songs. They have seen nothing yet."
 wild_hunt_bosmerrites:0 "Bosmer Rites"
 desc_wild_hunt_bosmerrites:0 "The Great Y'ffre has granted us a boon."
 wild_hunt.4.stab:0 "We glorify in the destruction of others."
 wild_hunt.4.cash:0 "Let us loot the ruins of those who oppose us."
