 #Position 1
 all_thats_left_mission_title:0 "All That's Left"
 all_thats_left_mission_desc:0 "After centuries of bloody battles with the treacherous Yokudans, the Sinistral Elves make one final stand in the area of A'raei, an island off the coast of mainland Yokuda. Once a mighty empire stretching land four times the size of the Septim Dynasty, the Sinistrals have been reduced to a mere smattering of smoldering cities and saturated spires the tired and desolate Left-handed Mer must prepare themselves for the inevitable future."

 orichalcum_tower_mission_title:0 "Orichalcum Tower"
 orichalcum_tower_mission_desc:0 "Of the already elusive and scarcely understood Towers of Nirn the Orichalcum tower is perhaps the most mysterious and shrouded in rumors. Once a mighty tower it is now lost to the sunken continent of Yokuda and can only be reached underwater. When it was built, however, it boasted incredible powers centered around the mysterious orichalcum which it is constructed from. Orichalcum is well known in later eras, especially in regards to the Orcs and other races with a strong military tradition. However in the Merethic era it was quite rare and advanced, offering great powers to those who could wield it. While orichalcum would ultimately lead to the downfall of the Sinistrals when given to the hands of the Yokudans, it played a large part in their rise as an empire on the continent of Yokuda."
 sinister_intentions_mission_title:0 "Sinister Intentions"
 sinister_intentions_mission_desc:0 "After centuries of battle and bloodshed the Sinistral Elves, reduced to a mere speck of their former glory, have begun to fight back against the Yokudans. All is not lost, as long as the Left Handed Mer can band together and take out the ruling factions of the Na Totambu of Yokuda there is hope yet."
 out_on_limb_mission_title:0 "Out on a Limb in Alinor"
 out_on_limb_mission_desc:0 "While the sinistral elves were being beaten and battered by the Yokudans they began exploring options outside of the continent, specifically in Summerset, where mer rule instead of man. Following the same faith and similar culture the Altmer may be the Sinistral Elves' last chance at survival."
 
 #Position 3
 gypsum_alabaster_mission_title:0 "Gathering Gypsum Alabaster"
 gypsum_alabaster_mission_desc:0 "One of the hallmarks of the Sinistral Empire was the ability to construct with the material gympsum alabaster. This allowed them to thrive in the harsh climates of Yokuda, staying warm when it was cold, and staying cool when it was hot. A second primary advantage of this material was its ready availability as a resource around Yokuda and ease of construction."
 buoyant_steel_mission_title:0 "Buoyant Steel"
 buoyant_steel_mission_desc:0 "Discovered by Thrassian sailors exploring the ocean depths, buoyant steel is believed to have been originally developed by the Sinistral Elves. Light but extremely durable, this material allowed for less naval attrition, quicker ships and greater hull strength."
 sin_nothing_right__mission_title:0 "Nothing Right About the Yokudans"
 sin_nothing_right__mission_desc:0 "After years of bloodshed and vicious battles the Yokudans have finally started to retreat and plan their own defenses. It is imperative to seize this opportunity and begin conquering Yokuda again in the name of the Sinistrals."
 pyandonean_ports_mission_title:0 "Ports in Pyandonea"
 pyandonean_ports_mission_desc:0 "After vicious destruction and prosecution of the Sinistral Elves they were forced to be completely annihilated as a race or flee to protective sanctuary. Summerset has promising land to start over, but there is a strong Altmer precense already there and the same issues of racism and descrimination are beginning to occur. The Sinistral Elves eventually would be reduced to a handful of individuals who would end up on Pyandonea, safe from threats but in an extremely inhospitable landscape. Will the Sinistrals survive to build an empire anew, or be forgotten in the annuls of history?"
