 spiritual_pursuits_mission_desc:0 "Into and through the desert go shamans and hermits; within and without the desert go pilgrims and derelicts. It is the summoning ground, the burial ground, the ground of the Great Serpent Shakatel who rips reality bare and strips delusion from her bones. Here is the great trial, the murder of things to come. Here is the great ocean, swallowing all that's come to pass. Here the most spiritual and wisest among us have yearned for the sweet release of retreat. Not in order to escape reality, but to discover it."

 legacy_ehlnofey_mission_desc:0 "It is largely unknown what the beginnings of time held on Nirn, and much is left to conjecture. Perhaps the most salient tale, or at least the widest-encompassing, is that during the creation of Nirn and Mundus many of the progenitors left their creation and continued on to new worlds and possibilities. But those who stayed, the Ehlnofey, were attached to their creation and wanted to make it thrive. Over time this mysterious and elusive race began to travel and split along various veins in Nirn. There were other Ehlnofey, however, who by the force of others or their own accord wandered the lengths of the planet for new homes. Those who settled down in the rich continent of Tamriel became content and satisfied as they evolved into Mer. They could live very long and became very powerful as individuals, but sparingly repopulated. Those who rattled around the rest of Nirn, into Akavir, Atmora, and yes, even Yokuda faced toils and hardships and were forced to adapt to some of the toughest land in Nirn, evolving into Men. They did not live so long but were hearty and tempered by their environment, and this adaptation led to much higher birth rates. Eventually these two groups, the Old Ehlnofey, now the Mer, and the Wanderers, now the Men, came into conflict as Men saw Tamriel as a more fitting home. In many cases Men were forced to move into Tamriel when their own homes became inhospitable. Having conquered their environments, and having vastly superior numbers the Men managed to overwhelm the Mer. The wanderers who landed on the desert continent who would bear their name are the Yokuda. This is simply a tale, a piece of legend passed down from tongue to tongue, taking on new flavors and adventures with each retelling. It gives us the beginning to our story, the rest is up to history."

 song_of_sword_mission_title:0 "Song of the Blade"
 song_of_sword_mission_desc:0 "Originally a spiritual pursuit in the vast desert habitat, vicious civil wars in Yokuda led the meditative resolve of Yokudan mystics to transform their art into a martial art, the art of the sword, the Song of the Blade. Over time inclusion in the Sword Singers became more exclusive and depended on the spiritual mastery of the individual, not the blade they weld. In fact, it is a foremost belief among Sword-Singers that it is the swordsman, not the sword, that matters. To the Sword-Singer, there is no enemy but the Self, no trial but the Self, no goal but the Self. When meeting a foe in battle they see that individual not as the enemy but as a comrade in battle, a partner in the dance. In each fight the swordsman meets himself or herself through the sword and the individual matching their blade is simply the occasion or excuse for this higher purpose, this meeting of the Self, and destruction of the self, so the self may be transformed anew. In each transformation the Self is a tempered blade forged of its impurities and closer to its goal: the sweet emptiness of Enlightenment, Oneness with the Sword. In truth it is never possible to attain the goal of the sword, only march ever-closer to its white hot blade so that one may die, and be born again."

This council was a coalition of Yokudan nations balanced by a ruler. In many occasions civil war led the Yokudan nations to fragment and reform hundreds of times over, placing power in various states' hands as the overall empire became solidified. Despite the strife violence across Yokudan nations they all had one thing in common, a hatred for the Sinistral Elves. This hate would ultimately bind them together and allow an empire to rise."

 rise_frandar_hunding_mission_desc:0 "Frandar Hunding was born into the empire era of Yokuda, before the Ra Gada waves on Hammerfell and when the continent was united under Yokudan rule and free of disaster. Rising among the sword singers he became a master ansei at a very young age. The Ansei were the greatest of the sword singers, known also as Saints of the Sword and were capable of creating a shehai or spirit sword from their own essence and wielding it as the deadliest possible weapon. The various ranks of Ansei ranged from simple initiation for those who had the capacity to form a spirit-sword to complete independence from material weapons as the master ansei could create weapons through will alone. Far from being warmongerers or glory-seekers the highest ranks of the ansei, and thus the sword-singers themselves, required extreme mental will, spiritual resolve, devotion to the gods of war, and utmost patience. Only then would they be capable of wielding the shehai and facing their foes. Thus it is remarkable that Frandar Hunding accomplished so much at such a young age, both in regards to mastery of swordsmanship but also his detachment from material reality and dedication to the spiritual aspects of the sword. When he was 14 his father died, leaving him in charge of his household and the primary source of income for his family; despite this he continued his training and achieved mastery by the age of 17. By the age of 30 he had won 90 duels, killing all of his opponents single handedly, and decided to retreat into the Hattu mountains of Toramon as he had deemed himself invincible and in need of no further training. There he wrote the famous Book of Circles, the most famous and extensive book on swordsmanship ever written, taking as long to write it as he had to live it. Eventually reality would beckon him and his skills back from the mountains as Yokuda was once more plagued with civil war. From there he would win a decisive victory over the emperor and begin the Ra Gada, or warrior waves, on Hammerfell."

Initially, the emperor had sole diplomatic power over the various states of Yokuda, however over time during the late Merethic and Early First era the emperorship became more of a token then an actual seat of power as various dynastic functions were stripped away and a figurehead Elden Yokuda remained. Eventually the monarch Mansel Sesnit would rise to the throne and take back the ruling power, transforming his role as Elden Yokuda into Emperor of Yokuda and re-establishing the unified power of Yokuda."

While there was already a gulf between the austere and pious Sword Singers and the lowly peasant population he served to widen it considerably. He began a policy known as Torn's Sword Hunt which made it law that only Sword Singers could wear swords and set them apart from the rest of the population. While he made attempts to ameliorate the damage done by his predecessor he ultimately set the empire up for strife and upon his death another civil war broke out across Yokuda. The Emperor Hira, rising to power amongst this national crisis, decided to outlaw the sword-singers permanently, creating another contender in the battle for Yokuda. This became known as the War of the Singers as the vast armies of the empire fought the sparse but spartan Sword Singers. Eventually the calamity would collapse at the foot of Hattu Mountain where Frandar Hunding and his army of sword singers repelled the empire. Him, his son, and their army would eventually begin the Ra Gada, or Warrior Waves, into Hammerfell."

During his time he transformed his role as a political puppet dancing on the stage of higher powers into the puppetmaster himself, pulling on the delicate threads of diplomacy not so delicately until by force of his will and ingenuity of his mind he unified the powers that be into an Emperorship. In doing so he managed to upset and anger much of the population, becoming vilified by Yokudans.

This rivalry, lasting thousands of years and involving countless battles and wars, culminated in a final Sinistral population pigeonholed off the coast of mainland Yokuda. The empire of Yokuda and its ruling council, the Na Totambu, were at a standstill in deciding how to finish their final battle with the elves, and were visited by Diagna, an avatar of the God HoonDing, who brought Orichalcum weapons to the Yokudans allowing them to achieve a decisive victory. While there were still survivors following this vicious war scattered throughout Yokuda the imminent collapse of the continent and sinking of Yokuda lead to their absolute extinction."

 ra_gada_mission_desc:0 "The Ra Gada were four successive warrior waves conducted by the Yokudans against the province of Hammerfell in the 8th and 9th centuries of the first era, starting in the western coast and moving further inland until the land was conquered. The first two waves were expeditionary in nature, as the sword singers, led by Frandar Hunding, abandoned Yokuda after the aftermath of the War of the Singers and decided to begin anew. Later, following the destruction and sinking of the continent of Yokuda, many of the leading factions of Yokuda were forced to emigrate to Hammerfell, settling in the wake of destruction that the warrior waves had left behind and establishing the ruins as new footholds in the twenty eight year campaign. As the sword singers moved inwards the nobility, merchants, and main population inhabited the coasts west and north of Hammerfell and began establishing new cities. Because the land in Hammerfell, despite being inhospitable compared to other regions of Tamriel, had much better land than Yokuda the novel techniques established by the Yokudans in their old homeland made irrigating and developing their new home much easier."

However, the land in Yokuda, where the Yokudans had thrived for centuries and developed ingenious techniques of irrigation, infrastructure and development in arid and inhospitable terrain gave the Yokudans the perfect edge to survive in the previously uncolonizable states of the Alik'r Desert."

This forced many of the remaining citizens to flee in immigration to Hammerfell. While they settled the Pearl and Chain islands, the warrior wave continued into Hammerfell, beginning the Taven Wave that moved southwest into Hammerfell, the areas of Anwein, Taneth and Rihad. Their success was quick and efficient as they quickly overwhelmed their foes. The Yokudans, upon encountering elven strongholds along the coast of Hammerfell, decimated the Mer without mercy as they reminded the Yokudans of their ancient foes, the Sinistral Elves. When moving into the desert they also found many goblin strongholds which were razed without thought as the Yokudans exterminated these demons from their self-proclaimed new home."

Some of these individuals would end up settling down on the northern coast of Hammerfell and establishing religious centers there. The most notable was the resurrection of the new city of Na Totambu. Na Totambu both refers to the Yokudan ruling class and also to the location of political power.

Tensions increased as orcs lashed out and made precise and untraceable strikes on various settlements across High Rock. While the Yokudans numbered far fewer than Bretons in the Province the Bretons required their superior skills in battle to wage war on the orcs. Discussions began between the two races on how to deal with the third. These events would lead to beneficial alliances between Breton and Yokudan alike, as they prepared for war with the orcs."

 old_traditions_new_worlds_mission_desc:0 "Following the Ra Gada and subsequent conquest of Hammerfell the sword singers were no longer in their prime. While they were as deadly as ever, and had a large following, unfortunately necessity dictated that a powerful cutting edge military was not the highest priority for the fledgling nation. By this time Old Yokuda was transitioning to becoming Hammerfell and needed to focus on infrastructure, development, and politics. However the sword singer tradition cannot be destroyed or lost, there will always be an individual with the spirit of the sword within them. Something closer to a standing military than individual bands of nationalist mercenaries began to develop and training schools were established. While the intense discipline and spiritual nature of the art was beginning to fade, more individuals were able to carry and wield swords than ever before, every home had a copy of Frandar Hunding's Book of Circles, and most importantly: Hammerfell had become the preeminent military and diplomatic power of Western Tamriel. In this way the modern Redguard, which is a martial society where everyone is required to have a basic proficiency in swordsmanship, religion, and culture (and in fact a distinction between these is hard to find for any Redguard) has advanced markedly from Old Yokuda, where society was very segregated and for a time only sword singers of rank were even allowed to carry a sword."

With nothing left to lose they forged forward with greater intensity than ever and conquered the northwestern coast of Hammerfell, including the areas of Hegathe, Chastown, and most importantly Sentinel. Sentinel would become the new capital of the Yokudans, established by the leader Yaghoub after he mercilessly razed the city to ashes and rebuilt it in the Yokudan style.

The Alik'r desert, while being some of the most inhospitable land in Tamriel, had much more conducive soil and climate than the Yokudan Deserts that were now far beneath the sea. Several innovations brought to Tamriel included collapsible buildings with flying staircases and ornamental domes that could be built and repaired after frequent natural disasters and complex heating and cooling ducts that regulated temperature year round. Because of their immense knowledge of irrigation and water collection the Yokudans were able to find and establish cities in the vast oases of the Alik'r desert, building cities around the centers of water and thus trade."

At the time no single force could match the might of the orcs and their extremely defensible capital in the mountains of eastern High Rock. In the middle of the 10th century first era, King Joile of Daggerfell sent a letter to Gaiden Shinji of the Order of Diagna and they began a collective force to siege Orsinium, an alliance of High Rock and Hammerfell against the province of Wrothgar. The Siege lasted 30 years and eventually ended when the collective troops rushed in and razed the city.

This was replaced by a preeminent military nationalism that allowed for a powerful standing army in its own right without the detailed esoteric practices involved in producing swordsman and shehai; the latter of which was believed absurd by the plebeians of Hammerfell who had found themselves firmly rooted in materialism. Despite this training schools such as the Rahni'Za, the Abbey of the Blade, and the Citadel in Craglorn offered places to learn the lost art and develop a new way of the sword for future generations."

This sparked new tensions in the area as Nords, Keptu, and other tribal human races encountered the incoming Yokudans and were wiped out so completely it's difficult to accurately portray a record of them ever existing. According to the Yokudan legends, which, as biased as they may be are the only source we have, the power of the shehai produced by the sword singers was so powerful it could cut through bone, armor and stone equally, allowing for extremely fast sieges and wins for the Yokudans in their final warrior wave."

To orchestrate this he suggested the leader of the Orcs and Yokudans each face off in a duel to determine the rightful winner, then had his archers execute both contendants as soon as they entered the dueling arena. From there Jolie took his main force around the coasts of the Iliac Bay south towards Sentinel, but was stopped and slain in his tracks by an incumbent Swordsinger. Following this the siege was won and relations between the new leaders of Hammerfell and High Rock were maintained and old issues resolved. Over time, to maintain trade power in the region the Yokudans lost the majority of their language as they picked up the cultural patterns of the native Bretons and spoke that tongue or a hybrid of mostly Breton with regional Yokudan dialects. In this way the Yokudans gave up much of their cultural heritage in order to survive and thrive within the lucrative Breton society."

 rourken_clan_mission_title:0 "Roil of the Rourken Clan"
 rourken_clan_mission_desc:0 "During the first era the Dwemer of Morrowind encountered violent political and cultural strife with the native Chimer, the latter of which would become the modern Dunmer. This strife turned towards reluctant diplomatic friendship as neighboring Nords began to conquer Morrowind and during the reign of King Vrage of Skyrim much of the province was conquered under the banner of the Old Kingdom. This banner would come to represent the eventual rise of the races of men over mer and by 240 of the first Era Vrage had conquered the majority of Morrowind outside of Vvardenfell. In order to combat this insurgence of men unrightfully marching through Morrowind the First Council was established to create an alliance between Chimer and Dwemer under the new Banner of Resdayn with the leaders of both sides: Dumac of the Dwemer and Indoril Nerevar of the Chimer fighting alongside one another and ultimately driving out the Nords in 1E 416. Dumac and Nerevar would be the leaders of the First Council until their untimely deaths during the War of the First Council over 200 years later. However, when the First Council first arose, King Rourken and his clan of Dwemer held great animosity for the Chimer and refused to join. He voluntarily flung his fabled Hammer Volendrung towards the setting sun where it landed in the Alik'r Desert, what was appropriately named 'Hammerfell.' They migrated there in 1E 420, long before the arrival of the Yokudans and managed to populate and establish the area where many had failed before. Mysteriously, as with the other Dwemer across Tamriel the Rourken Clan would disappear completely, leaving the entire skeleton of their society intact beneath the sinking sands. When the Ra Gada did arrive they quickly overwhelmed the orcs and goblins in the Alik'r Desert and built their own cities on top of those buried beneath the sand, establishing themselves as the rightful owners of 'Hammerfell.' While historically the Yokudans and Rourkens never interacted if the Redguard invasion had occurred during the peak of Dwemer presence in Hammerfell history may have gone a much different way. One could speculate that the powerful shehai magic of the sword singers would have competed with the hyperadvanced technologies of the Dwemer which far outmatched those available to the Corelanyans, Goblins, and Keptu who fell so quickly to the Yokudans, and the Redguard invasion would not have progressed as quickly and efficiently as it did."

This transformed the once hotbed that was High Rock and the Illiac coast into an extremely defensible force as well as permanently bringing together the once mortal enemies of the region and establishing a Union in northwestern Tamriel."
