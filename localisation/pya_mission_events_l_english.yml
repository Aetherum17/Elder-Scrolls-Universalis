 py_mission_events.1.d:0 "Orgnum was once a wealthy Aldmer merchant who resided in Old Aldmeris and led a noble coup against the political leaders there. This rebellion ultimately failed and Orgnum, along with his followers, were exiled to Pyandonea, the 'Veil of Mists' to prevent any further incursions in Old Aldmeris. The ruling Aldmer would eventually immigrate across Tamriel and the most noble of them, the Altmer, would come to inhabit Summerset; land far richer and more amenable than the unforgiving swamplands of Pyandonea. The actual events that occured between Orgnum being banished to Pyandonea and the first documented Maormer raids on Summerset are largely unknown. What is known, however, is that Orgnum is an extremely powerful wizard claiming to have mastered his own mortality. He has spent centuries residing in Pyandonea as its population slowly evolved into what is the modern day Maormer, not only unifying the region and residing as its sole monarch but proclaming to be the Serpent-God Sakatel, creator and destroyer of worlds. Having ascended to King of Pyandonea he now promises to ascend even higher, achieving immortality in sublimation as a living deity."

 py_mission_events.2.t:0 "Control of Khenarthi's Roost"
 py_mission_events.2.d:0 "Having expanded their political influence into mainland Tamriel the Maormer became bolder in their ventures. Initial raids along the coast in isolated pockets became a coordinated privateering organization against the main trading ports of Southern Tamriel. A pivotal trading city targeted by Maormer pirates was Mistral, within Khenarthi's Roost in Southern Elsweyr. While occupying a pious place in the hearts of many Khajiit and a holy site for the deity Khenarthi the area also boasted numerous moonsugar plantations and offered a lucrative exploit for daring Maormer corsairs. Tensions escalated in Mistral between encroaching Maormer and resident Khajiit and eventually an envoy was sent to King Orgnum to establish the 'Treaty of Khenarthi's Roost.' The traty was mutually beneficial to both parties and presented several articles. The first created a maormer embassy in Mistral with resident ambassador and associated retinue; the conditions of which provided amenities, servents and even payroll by the Khajiit to the Maormer. Article 2 provided that the Maormer would become sole protectors of the Mistral port and every ship entering and leaving the port could be inspected by Maormer agents for contraband or any other perceived threat; searches were allowed without provocation and refusal to allow search was deemed hostile with permission to destroy or confiscate any such vessel. In return for this article 3 prevented Maormer from conducting any unprovoked acts of aggression against Mistral or otherwise friendly naval vessels; additionally the Maormer were not to interfere directly with trade in the port and 15 percent of all trade would be allocated towards the Khajiit. A 4th article was presented that would establish a feast day, named 'Serpent's Glory,' that would be open to all local residents of Port Mistral and invitations of the main feast relegated to approval by the Maormer ambassador with the Mayor permitted attendance with no more than three guests. Music and food for the celebration was to be provided by the Maormer and it is very clear in the treaty that by no means under any circumstance may the dish 'sugared cuttlefish' be served. This treaty would come to either establish lasting relations between the Maormer and Khajiit or become the beginning of the end for Mistral."
