 yok_mission_events.1.t:0 "Gifts from Diagna, Avatar of HoonDing"
 yok_mission_events.1.d:0 "During the Late Merethic and Early First Eras the Yokudans and Sinistral Elves waged many battles back and forth for control of the continent until there was little left of the lefthanded elves. The Sinistrals were cornered on a small island off the coast of Yokuda and it was up to the ruling Na Totambu to decide who would lead the final charge against their ancient foes. This came down to various sword singers from across the nation who performed their 'best known cuts' to no avail, as each master ansei was matched evenly. The great God of War Leki came to the Yokudan aid and introduced the Ephemeral Feint to decide the victor which led to war being declared on the sinistral elves. To aid the Yokudans the HoonDing, Orichalcum God of War, became the Avatar Diagna and brought orichalcum weapons to the Yokudans. Orichalcum, while more commonplace in later eras especially among races such as orcs with a strong military tradition, was extremely rare and advanced in the early first era and provided an overwhelming advantage against the failing Sinistral Elves. The Yokudans would eventually wipe out all the Sinistral Elves, and any remaining survivors fell into the ocean with the subsequent collapse of Yokuda."

 yok_mission_events.2.t:0 "The Sinking of Yokuda"
 yok_mission_events.2.d:0 "During the end of the 8th century of the first era the continent of Yokuda sank into the oceans, the majority of it lost to history. While the exact causes for this calamity are unknown, evidence points to some combination of natural disaster and the acts of rebel Yokudans themselves. Within the various schools of the ansei, the elite cadre of sword singers, were the Hiradirge, masters of stone magic. This group was zealotrous in their dedication to the sword and after being defeated in one of the many civil wars plagueing Yokuda were said to go into hiding. It is rumored that the Hiradirge, enacting their revenge, summoned the Pankratosword, a power which could sever the very laws of nature themselves and caused the imminent collapse. More rational and level-headed historians will claim that the events were simply due to random natural disaster and would have happened regardless of intervention. However these events may have been started, the result is clear: Yokuda is sinking into the seas and what was once a home for all is now a departure point for better frontiers. The former Empire has set its roots into Hammerfell, a much richer and promising venue then their old home; and they must decide whether to move their capitol to Hammerfell and start life anew, or try to regain control of disparate tribes on Yokuda and retain control of the Old Empire."
 yok_mission_events.2.immediate:0 "Due to continental natural disaster all provinces in Yokuda have accrued -3 of each development. The former Empire will be split back into the Ruling Na Totambu as various warlords use this calamity to vy for power. The fate of Yokuda is uncertain and dire."

 yok_mission_events.3.t:0 "Siege of Orsinium"
 yok_mission_events.3.d:0 "The yokudans who migrated to High Rock in the early first era were eventually met by expansion out of Hammerfell, from the Dragontail Mountains into the mountains of Wrothgar and bordering Orsinium, the great orcish stronghold. The growing political and military power of the orcs threatened the nearby Bretons who previously enjoyed economic and diplomatic influence over the region. Tensions built up until the middle of the 10th century first era when King Joile of Daggerfell made an alliance with the Order of Diagna, a religious order dedicated to the Avatar of HoonDing and the much larger nation of Hammerfell, home of the same descendents as the Order of Diagna. This joint coalition attacked Orsinium and began a 30 year siege against the ancient citadel. During this time the Order of Diagna was visited by the Avatar Diagna himself and led them into battle against the orcs, providing significant aid to the Order during extreme duress. The orcs managed to be extremely formidable in defending their homeland but eventually lost and Orsinium was razed to the ground."
