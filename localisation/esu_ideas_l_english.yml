 republik4: "Free Subjects"
 republik4_desc: "Although giving a servant a damn good thrashing might be satisfying, it is not the best way to actually get them to work harder. Some natural philosopher has hit on the idea of making profit the prime motivation for people. If we replace monetary rents with payment in kind, our peasants will be incentivized to produce more."
 republik1: "Diplomatic Mission"
