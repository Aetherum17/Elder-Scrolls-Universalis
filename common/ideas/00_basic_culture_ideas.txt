	#The Alfiq : The Alfiq are a diminutive form of magically gifted Khajiit resembling typical housecats. Their resemblance to common housecats has led many to treat them as such, whether by downplaying their intelligence, cooing at them or attempting to cuddle them. While it is rumored among outsiders that Alfiq are mute, they are in fact capable of speech. The misconception that Alfiq are incapable of speech may derive from the scholarly reduction of Alfiq to the status of housecats, or from a disinclination of Alfiq to talk in the presence of outsiders. Due to the disrespect that Alfiq get as a result of their form, they rarely travel outside Elsweyr.[59] All these factors resulted in Alfiq resenting being labeled as housecats, which they consider patronizing and irritating.[61] The grave lack of knowledge outsiders have of them does allow Alfiq to pose as housecats in order to serve as information gatherers. Alfiq wear clothing, but as they are unable to naturally put it on themselves, they either have others do it for them, or they use magic to clothe themselves.

It drives them into fits of ecstasy and abandon, purportedly leaving the streets of Elsweyr's major cities strewn with catmen shivering in the grip of sugar-fits. Despite the extremely addictive nature of the sugar, it is an integral part of Khajiit life and the chief export of Elsweyr, where it is smuggled out in both raw and refined forms known as Skooma
