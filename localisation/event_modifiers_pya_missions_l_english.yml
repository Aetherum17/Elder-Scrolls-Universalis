 desc_py_mi_veil_of_mist:0 "Early in their history the Maormer were separated from the altmer in Old Aldmeris. It is actually believed that all elves originally lived in Old Aldmeris, whether it be a location rooted in reality or a collective unconscious impression left in the genetic mind of all elves from wherever they originally came from. Through succesive migration the Altmer were to become High Elves, the Bosmer Wood Elves, the Dwemer Dwarf Elves, the Orsimer Orcish Elves and so forth. Despite wherever the homeland of elves once was, all elves have had enough time to evolve and become inhabitants of their own environments, in symbiosis with whatever habitat they encounter. While the maormer were relegated to the worst possible land in Nirn it has its advantages. Forced to deal with the unpredictable terrain and ferocious fauna the Maormer were able to develop their new homeland into an impossible fortress incable of invasion from outside powers: Pyandonea, 'Veil of Mist'"
