 ameliorating_malabal_tor_mission_title:0 "Ameliorating Malabal Tor"
 ameliorating_malabal_tor_mission_desc:0 "Historically the seat of Eplear Camoran, northern Valenwood is perhaps the most important region politically in Valenwood. It is essential the Bosmer crownlands as well as those of her subjects remain in Camoran control. Otherwise Valenwood is susceptible to invasions from the North." 
 ornery_orcs_mission_title:0 "The Ornery Orcs"
 ornery_orcs_mission_desc:0 "Historically the wood orcs have despised and outright opposed Bosmer occupation of Valenwood. They believe that simply because they inhabited the land originally and were increasingly forced out of their settlements that they have a rightful claim to Valenwood. The obviously conclusion is they're erroneously ornery, and must be dealt with. Otherwise they threaten to destroy the fabric of Bosmer society and wreak havoc on the peace the Camoran dynasty has worked so hard to ensure."
 
 green_pact_mission_title:0 "The Green Pact"
 green_pact_mission_desc:0 "Early in the Bosmer inhabitation of Valenwood they made an Oath to the great god Y'ffre in return for his patronage and protection. As a result the Bosmer place Y'ffre in the highest esteem; this being contrary to other mertheistic pantheons, which place Auri'El: the mighty Akatosh, as supreme deity. The oath stipulated that the Bosmer would not harm, consume or use any vegetation, going as far as requiring a carnivorous -in some cases, cannabalistic- diet. This oath, while cementing Bosmer religio-cultural practices, has some drawbacks. The wood elves must rely heavily on foreign trade to obtain the materials necessary to build an empire." 
 camoran_on_throne_mission_title:0 "Camoran on the Throne"
 camoran_on_throne_mission_desc:0 "In many ways the Province of Valenwood and the dynasty of Camoran are synonomous. It was Eplear Camoran who by uniting the disparate tribes of bosmer into one cohesive Province created a national identity. This allowed the Camoran dynastic administration to include all bosmer, regardless of bloodline, to be included in their regime and allowed for rapid and efficient integration of small city-states into the Province of Valenwood. In later eras, after the reign of Eplear had long been eclipsed, it would be nobles of the Camoran dynasty who would repeatedly return to the Camoran throne atop the walking city of Falinesti to wrestle control of Valenwood from foreign pretenders and restore order to the tempesteous forests of Y'ffre."
 gratifying_greenshade_mission_title:0 "Gratifying Greenshade"
 gratifying_greenshade_mission_desc:0 "While Eplear ruled primarily in northern Valenwood during the early years of his administration one of his principle successes would be to unite the treethranes of Greenshade."
 glory_of_grahtwood_mission_title:0 "Glory of Grahtwood"
 glory_of_grahtwood_mission_desc:0 "Within the grahtwood groves of southeastern Valenwood are some of the most reveared and holy sites of the Province. It is imperative that they are united under the Camoran dynasty, else they will fall to the treacherous Khajiit."
 camoran_dynasty_mission_title:0 "Camoran Dynasty"
 camoran_dynasty_mission_desc:0 "Through tireless work and diplomatic efforts the Camoran dynasty is united as the Province of Valenwood. This mighty nation now stands among the great Empires of Tamriel and has immortalized itself as a historical tour de force. Will Valenwood stand, united under the Camoran dynasty, or will it fall to the encroaching threat of humans arising at its borders?"
 
 placating_imgan_title:0 "Placating the Imgan"
 placating_imgan_desc:0 "Traditionally the Imga, great Apes of the Valenwood heartwoods, have tried to emulate and serve the Altmer. This being despite the fact that for all their efforts the Imgan nobles are not even allowed holdings of their own. Unlike the Altmer the Bosmer are Imga's neighbors and are prepared to concede titles and holdings... in return for their subjugation."
 
 valenwood_altmer_mission_title:0 "Trading with the Altmer"
 valenwood_altmer_mission_desc:0    "Historically the Bosmer were not able to produce and manufacture any trade goods involving vegetation. This has forced them to seek out new diplomatic allies to stimulate the foreign trade required to build an empire."
 valenwood_ayleid_mission_title:0   "Trading with the Ayleids"
 valenwood_ayleid_mission_desc:0    "While trade from Summerset has been imperative in allowing the Bosmer to thrive without exploiting vegetation, there are exciting opportunities available with with neighbors to the northeast."
 valenwood_alessian_mission_title:0 "Trade with the Nedes"
 valenwood_alessian_mission_desc:0  "Historically the Bosmer have been nothing short of Machiavellian when it comes to trade. Faced with the emminent destruction of the Ayleid Kingdom the wood elves were reluctant to concede either their diplomatic relations with the Ayleids or the trade income they had come to depend upon. While allowing ayleid refugees to inhabit Valenwood and protecting their freedom the Bosmer began to simultaneously create new trade relations with the growing Alessian Empire."
