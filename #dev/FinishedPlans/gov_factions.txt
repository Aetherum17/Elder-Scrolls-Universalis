 es_monks: The congregation of religious people in our nation. They care little for worldly matters except leading others to their path. Seeing politics and conflict as opposed to the Divine, they encourage us to follow the same path of peace, meditation and isolation. 
 es_governors: An elite among our citizens, the governours are in charge of a large part of the economy and local policies. Their are deeply afraid of any central planning and will resist any attempt to centralize, their main concern is increasing their power and autonomy. 
 es_bureaucrats: The bulk of our administrative machines, the bureaucrats tend to the everyday paperwork and administrative works. They are deeply attached to their jobs and their functions and tend to take more and more of it, to the point where our actual officials are nothing more than posters. 
 es_aristocrats: The political nobility in our country, the aristocrats spend most of their days' hunting, engaging in courts politics and managing their holdings. They sometimes come together to advance the interests of the state or their own.
 es_clergy: The sum of our scholars, priests and militants order, dealing with the spiritual life of our country, but also strongly advocate for us to walk the road of the Divines, their demands go from supporting the clergy to the removal of heretics, and they won't take being ignored.

 es_monopolists: The most wealthy of our traders, their contacts are many, and the debts people have to them are as great. They hold a large part of our economy, either directly or with men under their sway. Their power is so great that they now influence politics, to secure their business, gain even more wealth.
 es_traders: Where merchants can't go, you will find traders, they are seasoned merchants and representatives from guilds with the assets to travel far and wide, collect exotic good and resell them at a higher price, they do little else, but will compete whenever a profit or contract can be made.
 es_guilds: Our traders, merchants, and artisans have united themselves under several guilds. Those guilds offer them various advantages: protections, financial help, but they also close and control entry on the market. They also often compete on a political state, presenting candidates of their own to defend the position of the entire guild. 
 es_merchants: They are our normal economical agent, merchants buy and sell on the local level, they have little care for politics, but may seek any opportunity to make more money, even if it involves going into what they consider dirty business. 
 es_artisans: The main workforce of our economy and industry. Artisans have little care for politics as long as they are left alone and things go fine for them. Should the need arise, they may somehow manage to assemble to be represented.

 # es_warriors
 
 es_knights: The armed nobility of our society. Knights uphold great value and virtues. To them, war is merely a diplomatic tool and the opportunity to show their valour by proving themselves on the battlefield. They don't seek it, but the lack of it will slowly bore them.
 es_traditionalists: To some people, there is no need for change or progress, the status quo is just fine: "Why change a winning team?" Traditionalists will oppose any radical attempt at reform of the army or diplomacy. On the other hand, their lower ability makes for lower demands. 
 es_generals: The highest-ranking officers of our army are not only soldiers but also popular and political figures. Their main concern is the well being of the army, a decent funding and the best equipment possible. Should the be displeased, however, they could start to see themselves more fitted as a ruler.
 es_militarists: Members of our army but also civilians and militias banded together to support violent rhetoric for our country's defence. Militarists advocate for an army as big as possible to defend their homes but also attack whoever may threaten us. They are often well-armed and not afraid to use them.
 es_warriors: They live for war, skirmishes and the thrill of a fight. Local power and wealth are easily exchanged for the glory of the battlefield. They will rarely involve themself into politics but all guards and the local army will learn their teachings.
