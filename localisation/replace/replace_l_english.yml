Approaching the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], he asks permission to settle [rajput_scion_province.GetName], where he shall found a new town. He promises in exchange to accept the rule of the [Root.Country.GetAdjective] state and to raise an army in our support whenever it is needed."

 rajputs_estate_events.7.d:0 "Warrior nobles are a common sight at the court of [Root.Country.GetName], though it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between them and the other courtiers that make their home in [Root.Capital.GetName]. The Warriors at court have been thoroughly integrating into [Root.GetAdjective] aristocratic society, going so far as to learn the Persian language, observe [Root.GetAdjective] courtly etiquette, and personally accompany the [Root.Monarch.GetName] wherever [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] goes. This is leading to the loss of a distinctly Warrior voice at court, as these nobles have become more concerned with their advancement than in the interests of the Warrior community."

The marginalization of Warrior nobles and the neglect of Warrior soldiers has created an atmosphere of resentment and distrust that now threatens to erupt into violent conflict. Though it has become traditional for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to formally appoint Warrior clan leaders, in the current state of crisis our preferred candidate has been unanimously rejected by his would-be subjects. The Warriors of [Root.Country.GetName] now demand the right to appoint their leadership, and to be left to govern their affairs in provinces they control. They are prepared to install their chosen leader by force if we insist on maintaining our chokehold on dynastic politics."

Every Warrior leader must put kinship above all else, surrounding himself with a brotherhood of warriors and advisors all sharing descent from a patrilineal ancestor. Warrior soldiers must fight and die in service to their masters; nothing but absolute loyalty is acceptable.\n\nRather than attempting to suppress these traditional Warrior values and power structures, [Root.Country.GetName] has encouraged them, harmonizing them with service to the state and the [Root.Monarch.GetName].

They have petitioned the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for an immediate guarantee of religious tolerance, demanding that their traditions and customs be respected by law."

 rajputs_estate_events.11.d:0 "Warrior nobility has spread far and wide throughout the centuries, but a strong sense of kinship identity creates a common aristocratic culture. Warrior chiefs know their status and history concerning other Warriors going back many generations.\n\nOur advisors, among them many Warriors, suggest that these bonds could be exploited to the benefit of [Root.Country.GetName]. Most obviously, the Warrior chiefs loyal to us could act as ambassadors to the Warriors of nearby nations, enhancing our reputation in foreign courts. A more cunning option would be to exploit ancient grudges among the Warriors as a means to claim foreign territory."
